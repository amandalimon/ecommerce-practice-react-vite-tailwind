# Shopi: An E-commerce React App 

Welcome to Shopi â€“ where shopping meets simplicityðŸ’«

Crafted with the power of React.js, Vite.js, and Tailwind CSS, Shopi offers a dynamic and intuitive user experience. This project serves as a practice ground where I learned to seamlessly integrate these technologies into React, achieving a perfect synergy of style and practicality within the ecommerce domain.

## Key Features

- **Reactive Routing:** Utilizes React Router DOM for smooth navigation and an intuitive user experience.

- **API Consumption:** Interacts with an API to retrieve and display product information.

- **Product Detail Modal:** Implements a modal to view detailed information for each product.

- **Shopping Cart Management:** Allows users to add and remove products from their shopping cart.

- **Orders Pages:** Provides a main page listing all orders and individual pages for each order.

- **Product Search:** Enables users to easily search for products.

- **Product Filtering:** Allows filtering products by title and category for a personalized shopping experience.

- **Data Persistence:** Uses Local Storage to ensure users can complete their purchase flow even after closing the application.

- **Authentication:** Implements an authentication system for a personalized experience.

- **Dynamic Views:** Experience dynamic Sign-in views (Log In / Create Account) and a responsive Navbar that adjusts based on the user's authentication status, displaying options such as Email, My Orders, My Account, Sign Out, or Sign In.

- **Route Protection:** Ensures that only authenticated users have access to certain parts of the application.
